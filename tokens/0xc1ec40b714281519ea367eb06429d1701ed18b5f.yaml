  Anonymizer Ethereum (ATH) uses advanced cryptographic techniques, namely
  zero-knowledge proofs, to guarantee the validity of transactions without
  revealing additional information about them. The ether or tokens do not get out
  of your control and are on your balance in a smart contract. Only you have
  access to managing these balances!
