  StakeIt Token (STAKE) is a community-driven investment token allowing token
  holders to stake their tokens on a daily basis without any withdrawal or date
  limits through a centralized banking system. Token holders are required to pay
  small fees in ETH whenever depositing or withdrawing, and all revenues generated
  are used to buy-back and destroy tokens.
